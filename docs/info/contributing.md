# Contribute Guide

Welcome to the community!

Spotted an error? Have suggestions for improvements? or want to add something entirely new?
Here’s your go-to reference for contributing!

## About the Project

Our wiki is fully open source and maintained by a passionate community of developers and content creators.
You don’t need to be a member of our organization to contribute—just jump in, and let’s make this resource even better together!

## Getting Started

All wiki edits are handled through GitHub using pull requests,
so you can make changes and suggest edits directly in our GitHub repository.

### Step-by-Step Contribution Process

1. **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking our repository so you have your own copy to work on.
2. **Make Your Edits:** Whether you’re fixing typos, enhancing existing guides, or adding new pages, edit the Markdown files in your forked version.
3. **Submit a Pull Request (PR):** Once you’re happy with your changes, submit a PR to our main repository. We’ll review and get back to you as soon as possible!

### Guidelines for Contributions

Consistency and readability are our priorities.
Please follow these guidelines to ensure your contributions fit seamlessly into the rest of the wiki:

- **Use Consistent Styling:** Keeping a uniform style helps make guides clear and approachable.
- **Clear, Concise Language:** Avoid technical jargon where possible and prioritize clarity.
- **Follow Page Structure:** Refer to existing pages to get a feel for the flow and formatting.

For more details on setting up your environment and tips for using GitHub,
please check out the "Running Locally" section in the main README.md.
